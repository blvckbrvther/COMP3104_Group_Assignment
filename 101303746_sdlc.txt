From shopping to entertainment to banking, software and the Internet 
have changed the world and its sectors. Software is no longer just a 
means of supporting a business; it is now an intrinsic element of every
aspect of it. Companies communicate with their consumers using software 
that is supplied as online services or applications and may be used on a 
variety of devices.
They also leverage software to revolutionise every component of the value chain, 
including logistics, communications, and operations, 
to improve operational efficiencies. Firms in today's environment must adapt 
how they produce and distribute software in the same manner 
that physical goods companies revolutionised how they design, construct, 
and deliver things utilising industrial automation during the twentieth 
century.
